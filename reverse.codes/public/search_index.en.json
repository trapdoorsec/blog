Government will consult with industry on introducing an all-hazards\nconsequence management power that will allow it to direct an entity to take specific actions\nto manage the consequences of a national significant incident. This is a last-resort power,\nused where no other powers are available and where it does not interfere with or impede a\nlaw enforcement action or regulatory action.\n\nThe above would be difficult to pull off if it were considered completely legal and above board to silently pay off a ransomware\noperator as a private business responsible for privatized critical infrastructure.\nThis all appears to align with the current Privacy Act and its National Data Breaches Scheme's current threshold related to small businesses.\nFor now, consistency is probably a good thing so that it is not a mess of \"do I or don't I\" report a breach or a ransomware payment.\nThat said, the thresholds for cybercrime reporting vs, say, anti-modern day slavery commitments feel a bit back to front. Considering\nthat supply chain / modern slavery commitments begin at AUD$100M per annum (under the AG recommendation to lower this to $50M). Arguably, the\nimpacts of such supply chain issues has a bigger impact than ransomware currently, and with the advent of companies that\nmake it somewhat achievable\nto run a small value-add business on the back of forced labour, probably even more accessible to sub AUD$3M revenue generating companies.\nTo put this into perspective, depending on who you ask, ransomware in 2021 cost us around USD $20 Billion. The ILO argues that forced labour cost us an obscene USD$280 Billion.\nNot to downplay just how much impact cybercrime in total generates, nor the ransomware piece of that puzzle, yet I do feel\nthere is an opportunity for looking at the impact of technology availability in other areas, in the same breath as dealing with ransomware issues.\n","description":"","id":"https://reverse.codes/blog/cyber-security-act-q3-2024/","path":"/blog/cyber-security-act-q3-2024/","title":"Australian Cybersecurity Act proposals Q3 2024"},"https://reverse.codes/blog/the-cost-of-complacency/":{"body":"In an era where cyber threats loom larger than ever, being a good global citizen means prioritizing not just functional\nsoftware but also security by design. Security is an expected function.\n\nSoftware isn't difficult, humans are.\nYou know that overused joke in software circles about there being two\nhard things? Well, one of those things, 'naming things' I feel extends to defining things, because this is where software's\nvalue actually lies: the interpretation and delivery of human requirements, which are notoriously difficult to pinpoint sometimes.\nExample time, \"Make the car drive autonomously\" might look like a requirement to the average person, but in fact it is more of a desirement\nbecause it doesn't adequately express the complexities involved such that two different designs would both meet\na standard. Did you mean safely? What does that mean? Should it drive on the left or the right side of the road? Oh it's country\ndependant? How will it know, oh so it needs GPS. Right. What if that fails? *\nSo we need to understand, that to a product team, saying 'secure by default plzkthxbai' is really just a way of being annoying and 100%\nnon-constructive. They know it's a good idea, just... how?\nWhy do we even care about secure by default?\nOK so, I'll admit, if somebody says to me that secure by default is not a priority, I get a bit hot-blooded. It makes me want\nto lean into the fact that I'm a grumpy old man and tell the war stories again.\nReality is though, people clutch their pearls every time something awful happens, but nothing materially changes the status quo.\nThe Morris Worm incident\nIn 1988, an enterprising young student named Robert created what he thought was a harmless experiment to measure the size of\n... um... the internet.\n\nHowever, His program relied on a default password and a buffer overflow vulnerability in the canonical email service of the day: sendmail - a Unix program.\nHe designed a self replication component to his program, and before he could say 'off by one error' he had infected around 10% of\nthe internets servers at the time (approx 6000 machines), and caused millions of dollars damage in lost productivity.\nThis moment was pretty significant, in that it hadn't really happened on this scale before, but it also perfectly demonstrates\nwhy having insecure defaults opens us up to one of the nastiest types of malware: the worm - a self replicating program\ncapable of spreading itself without user interactions.\nThe Code Red Incident\nAnother example: we used to be OK with Windows Server 2003 leaving port 445 (SMB protocol) open on install. Code Red made\nespecially good use of this fact - some of you will remember - their cyberattack of 2001 which targeted another default\nconfiguration in IIS (open port 80). 24 hours, 350000 servers brought to their knees, billions in lost productivity. (Moore, Shannon, Klaffy 2002)\nYou can see where the product design decisions come from: make the internet easy to play with! Make networking easy! Minimize the clicks\na server admin needs to take in order to 'get online'! All laudable, money making ideas. Entirely insecure.\nAlas, these weren't entirely addressed until 5 years later, in Windows Server 2008 as Microsoft now had the 'very insecure'\nlabel that they probably wanted to shake.\nFast forward to 2024: IPv6 has the same problem\nIt has recently been revealed that IPv6 had a vulnerability, causing concern among IT professionals.\nThe reason for this is that it also is 'wormable'. Why is that? How can a bug in an internet protocol do that, when there was\nno default password?\nIn this case, the issue is that many devices and indeed operating systems, enable IPv6 by default, even though they don't strictly need it. Combine that fact with\nthe remote code execution vulnerability in IPv6, and suddenly, we have a worm.\nConclusion: Water is wet and investors don't care.\nAll this did not ruin Microsoft, Unix still exists today, SMB is still a protocol that is used.\nSo, none of the impacts where so bad that humanity cancelled them from all relevance. This tale is repeated in the Solarwinds\nbreach and Crowdstrike outages of late. Go have a look at Crowdstrike share price, I dare you.\n\nNow look at Equifax.\n\nIt would seem that lost productivity makes for a good (bad?) news story, but as a society, I don't think we value it as much as\njournalists would have you believe. Surely, we move to fix things all-proper-like when people die though, right?\nRight?\nStuxnet, WannaCry, Ransomware in general, heck arguably, even the old Therac-25 Radiation Therapy Machine of the 1980s were all situations\nwhere human lives could have been, if not were, affected because of insecure by design or other design flaws we would consider\nto be security adjacent.\nSo no, fact is, when it all comes down to the cold hard math of making said crusts, people (not just 'big evil companies' I might add),\nput their earning potential ahead of all else.\nThis is extremely short-sighted\nAt the moment we enjoy relatively cheap technology, maybe a few more ads than I'd like, but for those with enough means\nto purchase a device, much of the software you need to make your life easier is near enough to free.\nThe thing that does change though, is the rate at which we embed technology into the critical parts of our lives. This is a given.\nIn order to protect lives, we are now looking at the alternative solution to businesses regulating themselves. Of course,\nI mean governments doing the regulation bit. And this will make everything more expensive.\nWhere businesses fail to act, governments step in\nRemember when cars didn't have seat belts? OK, so I don't either, but that was a big issue in the 60s, people were dying enough that Ralph Nader wrote a book about it.\nThat led to loads of litigation and then government regulation, and finally, a massive increase in saftey.\nIt also added well over 10% to the price of a car, depending on what sources you refer to. Could businesses have avoided this? Could cars have been cheaper and safer?\nSo given the above, in my opinion, tech companies will have their 'Ralph Nader' moment in the future, and until then, things aren't likely to change.\nThe US Government is actually doing something meaningful to prevent the repeat of history\nEnter the CISA recommendations of 2023, which is the first attempt at\na government (that I'm aware of, at least), that tries to properly define 'secure by design'.\nThe subtext is often missed though. CISA is trying to give us all a massive hint: \"start doing these things before we force you to do them.\"\nThey know that the lawsuits are coming, governments are even enabling them, as one of the biggest customers of technology, this makes perfect sense.\nWhat if we adopted the CISA recommendations then...\nAlright, so you want to be a good global citizen and make software that is secure by design? First up. Thankyou, for trying to\nplay the long game, and make software cheaper for everyone by raising the bar and customers expectations!\n\nThere is no single solution to end the persistent threat of malicious\ncyber actors exploiting technology vulnerabilities, and products that are\n“secure by design” will continue to suffer vulnerabilities; however, a large\nset of vulnerabilities are due to a relatively small subset of root causes\n\n-Secure by Design: Principles and Approaches to Secure By Design Software, CISA, 2023\nIn this document two definitions now exist that you can hang your hat on as a product designer, or software engineer.\n\nSecure by design\n\"Secure by design\" means that technology products are built in a way\nthat reasonably protects against malicious cyber actors successfully\ngaining access to devices, data, and connected infrastructure Software\nmanufacturers should perform a risk assessment to identify and enumerate\nprevalent cyber threats to critical systems, and then include protections in\nproduct blueprints that account for the evolving cyber threat landscape.\n\n\nSecure by default\n“Secure by default” means products are resilient against prevalent\nexploitation techniques out of the box without added charge These\nproducts protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities\nwithout end-users having to take additional steps to secure them Secure\nby default products are designed to make customers acutely aware that\nwhen they deviate from safe defaults, they are increasing the likelihood\nof compromise unless they implement additional compensatory controls\nSecure by default is a form of secure by design\n\n\nSecurity should not be a luxury option, but\nshould be considered a right customers receive\nwithout negotiating or paying more.\n\nHonestly, there are so many good reasons to read this paper, just do it.\nSummarizing for you though, they do a great job of boiling this down to three core principles that any business owner can apply\nto their company.\n\nTake ownership of customer security outcomes\nEmbrace radical transparency and accountability\nBuild organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals\n\nFor product designers and engineers we go deeper:\n\nMemory safe language use\nLean on hardware that can use fine-grained memory protection\nAcquire and maintain secure software components (yes, this means libraries and middleware)\nLean on web frameworks that properly escape inputs\nUse parameterized database queries to avoid injection flaws\nUse static and dynamic application security testing tools to assist in error detection\nCode review should be a thing you do (i.e. QA)\nProvide an SBoM\nEstablish Vulnerability Disclosure programs\nInclude root cause or CWE references in CVE reports\nDesign infrastructure such that the compromise of a single security control does not result in total system compromise.\nMeet a baseline of Cybersecurity Performance Goals, which are too numerous to mention in this article, use this link as reference instead.\n\nAt what cost?\nYes, that's right. But if you properly consider history, every time we have a 'black swan' event your customers governments\nare more likely to react with legislation. If you simply build like this today, you amortize that cost over the course of years, not months.\nYour customers and investors probably won't notice immediately, but when your competitors jack their prices up, you'll be smugly pointing to all the good work you did\nover the past few years and reaping the churn.\nHistory shows us that without proactive measures from within, industries often face stringent external regulations. By adopting CISA’s 2023 recommendations now, technology companies can not only avert crises but also pave the way for a safer digital future. It’s not just about avoiding penalties—it’s about leading the charge towards a more secure world. What steps will you take to ensure your products are secure by design?\nFinal thought, consider how much government regulation costs other industries\nand start factoring it into your strategic thinking, today. Because the warning shots have been fired.\n*- Complete aside: In the authors opinion, this is why, time and time again, 'no code' solutions fail to live up to expectations (because they produce\nan unmaintainable mess that defies to be safely modified) and, why the armies of new wave AI-only 'programmers'\naren't taking all the jobs in IT (because programming isn't the only skill we're hiring for here).\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-14/ransomware-cyberattack-threat-lingers-as-people-return-to-work/8525554\nhttps://www.wired.com/2002/01/find-the-cost-of-virus-freedom/\nCode-red: case study on the spread and victims of an internet worm, D.
