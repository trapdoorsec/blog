Not the \"I'm getting grey beard hair\" kind of old, more like the \"I remember when this list first came out\", kind of old. Ok maybe a little with the grey hair.\nTo paint the picture for those who may not recall 2004: We had just landed the rovers on Mars, Usher &amp; Maroon 5 were a permanent fixture on the US charts, the dot-com bubble hangover was lifting, the memory of 9-11 was fresh in peoples minds and we had the global conflicts to show for it.\nIn cybersecurity, we were witnessing a shift. That January, the MyDoom mass emailer worm caused approximately $38 billion in damage globally - and variants would be seen in the wild for nearly five years. Symantec reported[2] a 366% increase in phishing and predicted that it would continue to rise - and they were right. Significantly, they also spotted that well over 40% of vulnerabilities documented between July 1 and Dec 31 of 2004 were web application vulnerabilities, an increase of 39% over the previous 6 months. This was a disturbing trend given we were betting the farm on web applications.\nThis was the backdrop when OWASP released their Top 10 Web Application Security Risks, version 2. It was meant to be a snapshot of the most critical vulnerabilities we faced.\n\nWhats changed since then?\nFast forward to today and the trends in cybersecurity sound very different yet feel vaguely familiar:\n\nThe concept of phishing - fooling people into clicking on a malicous link via email - has expanded to target the supply chain and other vectors: smishing, vishing, domain squatting, poison packages on npm, malicious browser in browser fakery etc. It gone from spray and pray to poison the well.\nAI powered social engineering augments the efforts of those executing the above attacks - its now possible to fake a voice or even video feed.\nDesktop viruses of old have given way to cloud misconfigurations\nThose script kids of 2004 have levelled up and become randomware-as-a-service operators, further lowering the barrier to entry for new miscreants to play dirty\n\nAnd finally, web apps have only increased their importance, with API and microservices, alongside OAuth and OIDC encouraging machine integration over the internet.\nOWASPs Top Ten over time\nFor the unintiated, this awesome community effort strives to collate quality data about the nature of web application cybersecurity attacks and publish them to web developers worldwide for free. I highly recommend being aware of its contents at all times if you're in the business of web application development in any capacity.\nWhen we compare how the OWASP Top Ten has evolved it provides us an interesting window into not only how attacks have evolved, but how we've responded.\n\nsource: my own diagram in whimsical, derived from historical OWASP content and the latest version 8 RC1\nThere is an \"I\" and \"A\" in \"CIA\"? Who knew?\nFor decades, developers treated Integrity and Availability as \"operations problems\" - write the code, throw it over the fence, let ops deal with the logs and uptime. That DevOps-shaped hole in our security posture is exactly what we're still trying to fill with CI/CD.\nSomething shifted around 2017. OWASP added \"Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring\" to the Top 10, essentially telling developers that 'your job doesn't end when the code compiles'. Good logs are a love letter to your support teams and incident responders. Design observability as a feature, not an afterthought.\nBy 2021, this evolved further with \"Software and Data Integrity Failures\" entering at #8. Now we're not just asking \"can you detect when you're breached?\" but \"can you prove your build pipeline hasn't been compromised?\"\n\nAn insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise.\n— OWASP Top 10 2021, A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures\n\nIn 2025 we're being much more prescriptive: use integrity checks for artifacts, please!\n\nAn insecure CI/CD pipeline without consuming and providing software integrity checks can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, insecure or malicious code, or system compromise.\n— OWASP Top 10 2025RC1, A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures\n\nTranslation: Supply chain security isn't optional anymore. If you can't verify what went into your build, you can't trust what came out of it.\nThe pattern: We spent 20 years perfecting Confidentiality (encryption, access control). We're finally realizing that data you can't trust or systems you can't observe are just as dangerous as data you can't protect.\nBuffer overflows have operating system level mitigations now\nBuffer overflows (aka BOFs), once the bain of the C/C++ programmer, were a significant issue, mainly due to the duopoly that was Apache and IIS web servers in the wild. This kind of attack would be a critical remote code execution issue - many inexperienced web server admins would also run apache or IIS with a high level of privilege out of laziness and lack of awareness.\nToday, not only are more webservers likely to run managed code (i.e. safe from buffer overflows by design), operating systems have stack protections that can randomize memory layout (ASLR), dynamic execution prevention and the like, making those BOFs much header to take advantage of should they exist.\nSupply chain attacks emerged\nWe built websites very differently too, in 2004 the concept of npm install leftpad simply didn't exist. Sharing code happened via blogs and dedicated code sharing sites, which in theory could have been a vector, but the reality is that they weren't used in the kind of capacity as a package would be leveraged in 2025.\nToday there are over 400k npm packages alone. This makes for a juicy target. In 2019 we all learned that a mere 20 compromised package maintainers on NPM could potentially infect over 50% of the entire ecosystem practically overnight - making for a very juicy target. [5]\nThis trend continues with the discovery of developer targeting malware like glassworm via marketplaces for our text editors, of all things. Notably, glassworm channels the bad old days of MyDoom's wormable nature.\nAI, obviously\nYou might be surprised that there is nothing related to AI or LLM's in the OWASP Top 10. Well, good news!\nBecause its such a unique space, the OWASP organization has given it a Top Ten all it's own: https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/ and you will note that its number one issue is... you guessed it ... prompt injection!\nThe uncomfortable constants\nWhat's stayed the same? In 2004, 70% of vulnerabilities were classified as easily exploitable, and 97% were considered moderately or highly severe prwire. [2]\nIn 2025? The numbers are actually worse. Roughly 38% of reported vulnerabilities in 2025 are rated High or Critical severity (CVSS ≥7), Early 2025 actually saw a spike in Critical CVSS 9+ vulns compared to prior years.[3]\nWhile in 2024, 42% of analyzed vulnerabilities had publicly available proof-of-concept exploits, significantly reducing the technical barrier for cybercriminals.[4]\nAt least by this yardstick, in 20 years we have little to show for our attempts at securing technology. We've definitely gotten better at distributing the same problems across more complex infrastructure though.\nAccess controls - still broken\nBroken access control is #1 on the OWASP Top 10 for a reason. As an industry, the economics of web development forced us to tackle the phishing problem first - identity and authentication (AuthN) get the budget and attention. Passkeys might finally kill credential theft. Cool.\nBut authentication is the easy problem. Authorization (AuthZ) is where we keep failing.\nThe reality? All the YubiKeys and passkeys in the world won't save you if a new user can access your admin panel by tweaking a role in their JWT.\nIf anyone can view customer data by incrementing an ID in the API call then its all for naught.\nPerhaps, we're close to getting \"who are you?\" right, but we still can't consistently answer \"what are you allowed to do?\".\nInjection still works :/\nWhat's fascinating about injection vulnerabilities is that we keep making this mistake. Just as we've wrapped our heads around the ramifications of a given query technology, we invent a new one with a whole new set of injection primitives to worry about:\n\n2004 - SQL databases were the norm → SQLi was rampant\n2010 - XML-RPC was common → XXE attacks emerged\n2015 - NoSQL databases became mainstream → NoSQL injection appeared\n2020 - GraphQL was everywhere → We stacked NoSQL injection with GraphQL-specific query manipulation\n2025 - LLMs are in production → Prompt injection, RAG poisoning, and indirect prompt injection are the new frontier\n\nThe underlying problem never changed: we're still concatenating untrusted input into interpreters. We just keep inventing new interpreters. In 2004, it was \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=\" + userInput.\nIn 2025, it's f\"Answer this question using the following context: {userInput}\". Same vulnerability. Different syntax. We learned to parameterize SQL queries, but forgot the lesson when we moved to NoSQL, GraphQL, and now AI prompts.\n\nConclusion: What Does This Mean Beyond 2025?\nTwenty years of OWASP Top 10 data tells us something uncomfortable: we're not getting better at the fundamentals. We're getting better at building complex systems that distribute the same old vulnerabilities across more layers.\nWill AI in the form of LLM based tools help us? That remains to be seen, however I remain sceptical of this, given that broken access control is still at the top. BAC issues stem from a lack of understanding or testing of the business rules unique to the application being built - that is to say, you can't prompt for what you don't know to ask for in the first place, and the LLM won't inherently detect every single RBAC rule your organization has come up with, at least not unless the LLM has direct access to that information - which seems unlikely to me. I think this is why humans will still be involved heavily in creating software well into the future.\nFor Defenders\nThe good news is that the appsec playbooks from 2004 largely still work. SQL injection prevention, access control validation, input sanitization—these aren't outdated techniques. They're eternal truths we keep forgetting.\nThe challenge is you now need to apply those fundamentals across:\n\n50 microservices\n400 npm dependencies\n12 cloud services\nAI prompts that look like natural language but behave like SQL queries\n\nActionable advice\n\nShift left, but verify right: DevSecOps is great, but runtime monitoring caught SolarWinds, CodeCov, and dozens of supply chain attacks that passed all the CI checks\nAssume compromise in your dependencies: Pin versions, use SBOMs, monitor for behavioral changes\nLog like someone's life depends on it: Because in healthcare, finance, and critical infrastructure, it actually might.\n\nFor Developers\nYou've inherited 20 years of technical debt disguised as \"best practices.\" From one of the old guard - I am sorry.\nThe uncomfortable truth, that npm package you installed? You're trusting 79 third-party packages and 39 maintainers on average. That GraphQL endpoint? It's just SQL injection with extra steps. That LLM feature? It's user input concatenation all over again.\nFirst Principles still matter\n\nUnderstand, don't just use: Frameworks protect you until they don't. Know why parameterized queries work, not just how to use an ORM\nTreat AuthZ like AuthN: You wouldn't skip password validation. Stop skipping resource ownership checks\nYour code will be attacked: Design with that assumption. Write logs that help future-you during an incident at 3 AM\nSupply chain hygiene: Review your dependencies like you review your own code. That leftpad incident wasn't a fluke—it was a warning\n\nThe mantra: If you're concatenating user input into anything that interprets it—SQL, NoSQL, GraphQL, shell commands, prompts—you're probably doing injection wrong.\nFor Leadership\nHere's what 20 years of data actually tells you:\n1. Security isn't getting easier\nYou can't \"buy security\" - never could. That SAST tool, WAF, or SIEM? They're necessary, but insufficient. Security is about your people:\n\nDeveloper training (they're shipping the vulns)\nArchitecture decisions (microservices = more attack surface)\nSupply chain verification (your code is 5% of your application)\nIncident response and threat hunting capabilities (you will be breached, but can you detect it?)\n\n2. The fundamentals haven't changed, but the economics have\nIn 2004, a breach meant some bad press. In 2025, it means:\n\nGDPR/DORA/CCPA/HIPAA fines (4% of global revenue)\nClass action lawsuits\nRansomware payments\nSupply chain liability (you breached your customers too)\nMillions wiped off stock prices overnight\n\nThe ROI on basic security hygiene has never been higher.\n3. Your developers are your security team (whether you like it or not)\nEvery line of code is a security decision. Every dependency is a trust decision. Every API endpoint is an attack vector. You can hire all the security engineers you want, but if your 50 developers ship 1,000 commits per week, security-by-review doesn't scale.\nInvestment priorities:\n\nTraining: Not compliance checkbox training. Real, practical secure coding for your stack\nTooling: SAST/DAST/SCA that developers actually use (not just buy)\nCulture: Making security a feature requirement, not a post-release patch\nObservability: You can't defend what you can't see. Log aggregation, SIEM, and actual human analysis\n\nCall to Action: How Does Your Application Stack Up?\nHere's your mission if you choose to accept it.\n\nTake 30 minutes: Walk through the OWASP Top 10 2025 RC1 and honestly assess which apply to your application\nCheck your dependencies: Run npm audit or equivalent. How many HIGH/CRITICAL vulns are you shipping?\nTest your logging: Simulate an attack. Can you detect it? Can you trace it? Can you respond to it?\nReview your CI/CD: Can you prove what went into your last build? Do you have integrity checks?\nAudit one critical endpoint: Pick your most sensitive API. Check for:\n\nBroken access control (can user A access user B's data?)\nInjection vectors (are you sanitizing/parameterizing inputs?)\nLogging (would you know if this endpoint was being abused?)\n\n\n\nThen ask yourself: If this application were breached tomorrow, would we:\n\nKnow about it within hours (not months)?\nUnderstand how they got in?\nBe able to prove what data was accessed?\nHave a response plan that doesn't start with \"panic\"?\n\nIf you answered \"no\" to any of those, start with the OWASP Top 10. It's been telling us the same story for 20 years.\nA Final Thought\nThe OWASP Top 10 isn't a prediction of the future. It's a reflection of our past.\nBuffer overflows dropped off not because we got smarter, but because we moved to languages that wouldn't let us make that mistake. SQL injection is still #3 not because it's hard to prevent, but because we keep forgetting to prevent it.\nThat's up to us.\n\nThanks for reading.

Government will consult with industry on introducing an all-hazards\nconsequence management power that will allow it to direct an entity to take specific actions\nto manage the consequences of a national significant incident. This is a last-resort power,\nused where no other powers are available and where it does not interfere with or impede a\nlaw enforcement action or regulatory action.\n\nThe above would be difficult to pull off if it were considered completely legal and above board to silently pay off a ransomware\noperator as a private business responsible for privatized critical infrastructure.\nThis all appears to align with the current Privacy Act and its National Data Breaches Scheme's current threshold related to small businesses.\nFor now, consistency is probably a good thing so that it is not a mess of \"do I or don't I\" report a breach or a ransomware payment.\nThat said, the thresholds for cybercrime reporting vs, say, anti-modern day slavery commitments feel a bit back to front. Considering\nthat supply chain / modern slavery commitments begin at AUD$100M per annum (under the AG recommendation to lower this to $50M). Arguably, the\nimpacts of such supply chain issues has a bigger impact than ransomware currently, and with the advent of companies that\nmake it somewhat achievable\nto run a small value-add business on the back of forced labour, probably even more accessible to sub AUD$3M revenue generating companies.\nTo put this into perspective, depending on who you ask, ransomware in 2021 cost us around USD $20 Billion. The ILO argues that forced labour cost us an obscene USD$280 Billion.\nNot to downplay just how much impact cybercrime in total generates, nor the ransomware piece of that puzzle, yet I do feel\nthere is an opportunity for looking at the impact of technology availability in other areas, in the same breath as dealing with ransomware issues.\n","description":"","id":"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/cyber-security-act-q3-2024/","path":"/blog/cyber-security-act-q3-2024/","title":"Australian Cybersecurity Act proposals Q3 2024"},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/the-cost-of-complacency/":{"body":"In an era where cyber threats loom larger than ever, being a good global citizen means prioritizing not just functional\nsoftware but also security by design. Security is an expected function.\n\nSoftware isn't difficult, humans are.\nYou know that overused joke in software circles about there being two\nhard things? Well, one of those things, 'naming things' I feel extends to defining things, because this is where software's\nvalue actually lies: the interpretation and delivery of human requirements, which are notoriously difficult to pinpoint sometimes.\nExample time, \"Make the car drive autonomously\" might look like a requirement to the average person, but in fact it is more of a desirement\nbecause it doesn't adequately express the complexities involved such that two different designs would both meet\na standard. Did you mean safely? What does that mean? Should it drive on the left or the right side of the road? Oh, it's country\ndependent? How will it know, oh, so it needs GPS. Right. What if that fails? *\nSo we need to understand, that to a product team, saying 'secure by default plzkthxbai' is really just a way of being annoying and 100%\nnon-constructive. They know it's a good idea, just... how?\nWhy do we even care about secure by default?\nOK so, I'll admit, if somebody says to me that secure by default is not a priority, I get a bit hot-blooded. It makes me want\nto lean into the fact that I'm a grumpy old man and tell the war stories again.\nReality is though, people clutch their pearls every time something awful happens, but nothing materially changes the status quo.\nThe Morris Worm incident\nIn 1988, an enterprising young student named Robert created what he thought was a harmless experiment, presumably, to measure the size of\n... um... the Internet. (Morris is reported to have stated that he only did it to see if it could be done.)\n\nHowever, his program relied on a default password and a buffer overflow vulnerability in the canonical email service of the day: sendmail - a Unix program.\nHe designed a self replication component to his program, and before he could say 'off by one error' he had infected around 10% of\nthe Internets servers at the time (approx 6000 machines), and caused millions of dollars damage in lost productivity.\nThis moment was pretty significant, in that it hadn't really happened on this scale before, but it also perfectly demonstrates\nwhy having insecure defaults opens us up to one of the nastiest types of malware: the worm - a self replicating program\ncapable of spreading itself without user interactions.\nThe Code Red Incident\nAnother example: we used to be OK with Windows Server 2003 leaving port 445 (SMB protocol) open on install. Code Red made\nespecially good use of this fact - some of you will remember - their cyberattack of 2001 which targeted another default\nconfiguration in IIS (open port 80). 24 hours, 350000 servers brought to their knees, billions in lost productivity. (Moore, Shannon, Klaffy 2002)\nYou can see where the product design decisions come from: make the Internet easy to play with! Make networking easy! Minimize the clicks\na server admin needs to take in order to 'get online'! All laudable, money making ideas. Entirely insecure.\nAlas, these weren't entirely addressed until 5 years later, in Windows Server 2008 as Microsoft now had the 'very insecure'\nlabel that they probably wanted to shake.\nFast forward to 2024: IPv6 has the same problem\nIt has recently been revealed that IPv6 had a vulnerability, causing concern among IT professionals.\nThe reason for this is that it also is 'wormable'. Why is that? How can a bug in an internet protocol do that, when there was\nno default password?\nIn this case, the issue is that many devices and indeed operating systems, enable IPv6 by default, even though they don't strictly need it. Combine that fact with\nthe remote code execution vulnerability in IPv6, and suddenly, we have a worm.\nConclusion: Water is wet and investors don't care.\nAll this did not ruin Microsoft, Unix still exists today, SMB is still a protocol that is used.\nSo, none of the impacts where so bad that humanity cancelled them from all relevance. This tale is repeated in the Solarwinds\nbreach and Crowdstrike outages of late. Go have a look at Crowdstrike share price, I dare you.\n\nNow look at Equifax.\n\nIt would seem that lost productivity makes for a good (bad?) news story, but as a society, I don't think we value it as much as\njournalists would have you believe. Surely, we move to fix things all-proper-like when people die though, right?\nRight?\nStuxnet, WannaCry, Ransomware in general, heck arguably, even the old Therac-25 Radiation Therapy Machine of the 1980s were all situations\nwhere human lives could have been, if not were, affected because of insecure by design or other design flaws we would consider\nto be security adjacent.\nSo no, fact is, when it all comes down to the cold hard math of making said crusts, people (not just 'big evil companies' I might add),\nput their earning potential ahead of all else.\nThis is extremely short-sighted\nAt the moment we enjoy relatively cheap technology, maybe a few more ads than I'd like, but for those with enough means\nto purchase a device, much of the software you need to make your life easier is near enough to free.\nThe thing that does change though, is the rate at which we embed technology into the critical parts of our lives. This is a given.\nIn order to protect lives, we are now looking at the alternative solution to businesses regulating themselves. Of course,\nI mean governments doing the regulation bit. And this will make everything more expensive.\nWhere businesses fail to act, governments step in\nRemember when cars didn't have seat belts? OK, so I don't either, but that was a big issue in the 60s, people were dying enough that Ralph Nader wrote a book about it.\nThat led to loads of litigation and then government regulation, and finally, a massive increase in safety.\nIt also added well over 10% to the price of a car, depending on what sources you refer to. Could businesses have avoided this? Could cars have been cheaper and safer?\nSo given the above, in my opinion, tech companies will have their 'Ralph Nader' moment in the future, and until then, things aren't likely to change.\nThe US Government is actually doing something meaningful to prevent the repeat of history\nEnter the CISA recommendations of 2023, which is the first attempt at\na government (that I'm aware of, at least), that tries to properly define 'secure by design'.\nThe subtext is often missed though. CISA is trying to give us all a massive hint: \"start doing these things before we force you to do them.\"\nThey know that the lawsuits are coming, governments are even enabling them, as one of the biggest customers of technology, this makes perfect sense.\nWhat if we adopted the CISA recommendations then...\nAlright, so you want to be a good global citizen and make software that is secure by design? First up. Thank you, for trying to\nplay the long game, and make software cheaper for everyone by raising the bar and customers expectations!\n\nThere is no single solution to end the persistent threat of malicious\ncyber actors exploiting technology vulnerabilities, and products that are\n“secure by design” will continue to suffer vulnerabilities; however, a large\nset of vulnerabilities are due to a relatively small subset of root causes\n\n-Secure by Design: Principles and Approaches to Secure By Design Software, CISA, 2023\nIn this document two definitions now exist that you can hang your hat on as a product designer, or software engineer.\n\nSecure by design\n\"Secure by design\" means that technology products are built in a way\nthat reasonably protects against malicious cyber actors successfully\ngaining access to devices, data, and connected infrastructure Software\nmanufacturers should perform a risk assessment to identify and enumerate\nprevalent cyber threats to critical systems, and then include protections in\nproduct blueprints that account for the evolving cyber threat landscape.\n\n\nSecure by default\n“Secure by default” means products are resilient against prevalent\nexploitation techniques out of the box without added charge These\nproducts protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities\nwithout end-users having to take additional steps to secure them Secure\nby default products are designed to make customers acutely aware that\nwhen they deviate from safe defaults, they are increasing the likelihood\nof compromise unless they implement additional compensatory controls\nSecure by default is a form of secure by design\n\n\nSecurity should not be a luxury option, but\nshould be considered a right [that] customers receive\nwithout negotiating or paying more.\n\nHonestly, there are so many good reasons to read this paper, just do it.\nSummarizing for you though, they do a great job of boiling this down to three core principles that any business owner can apply\nto their company.\n\nTake ownership of customer security outcomes\nEmbrace radical transparency and accountability\nBuild organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals\n\nFor product designers and engineers we go deeper:\n\nMemory safe language use\nLean on hardware that can use fine-grained memory protection\nAcquire and maintain secure software components (yes, this means libraries and middleware)\nLean on web frameworks that properly escape inputs\nUse parameterized database queries to avoid injection flaws\nUse static and dynamic application security testing tools to assist in error detection\nCode review should be a thing you do (i.e. QA)\nProvide an SBoM\nEstablish Vulnerability Disclosure programs\nInclude root cause or CWE references in CVE reports\nDesign infrastructure such that the compromise of a single security control does not result in total system compromise.\nMeet a baseline of Cybersecurity Performance Goals, which are too numerous to mention in this article, use this link as reference instead.\n\nAt what cost?\nEvery time we have a 'black swan' event your customers governments are more likely to react with legislation.\nIf you simply build like this today, you amortize that cost over the course of years, not months. A recent estimate puts this\ncost in the US at \"$300 billion annually, only $53 billion less than firms spend on corporate income taxes.\" (T)\nYour customers and investors probably won't notice immediately, but when your competitors jack their prices up, you'll be smugly pointing to all the good work you did\nover the past few years and reaping the churn.\nHistory shows us that without proactive measures from within, industries often face stringent external regulations. By adopting CISA’s 2023 recommendations now, technology companies can not only avert crises but also pave the way for a safer digital future. It’s not just about avoiding penalties—it’s about leading the charge towards a more secure world. What steps will you take to ensure your products are secure by design?\nFinal thought, consider how much government regulation costs other industries\nand start factoring it into your strategic thinking, today. Because the warning shots have been fired.\n*- Complete aside: In the author's opinion, this is why, time and time again, 'no code' solutions fail to live up to expectations (because they produce\nan unmaintainable mess that defies to be safely modified) and, why the armies of new wave AI-only 'programmers'\naren't taking all the jobs in IT (because programming isn't the only skill we're hiring for here).\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-14/ransomware-cyberattack-threat-lingers-as-people-return-to-work/8525554\nhttps://www.wired.com/2002/01/find-the-cost-of-virus-freedom/\nCode-red: case study on the spread and victims of an internet worm, D.

This CTF teaches the importance of keeping libraries up to date, avoiding allowing untrusted users to run code on your infrastructure, even when you've tried to sandbox them.\nExecutive summary\nCodePartTwo is vulnerable to a sandbox escape CVE-2024-28397 leading to remote code execution on the server as the app user. This allows an attacker to access the application database which contains a raw MD5 hash for another user marco. This password is both crackable in under a minute on modern hardware, and is reused as the SSH password for marco. Further, despite marco being a low privilege user, they are allowed to run npbackup-cli as the superuser.\nUnfortunately this CLI tool can be configured to read and write to the root filesystem allowing a low privileged user to acces the root SSH private key, which is passwordless, and gain full access to the box.\nTesting Method\nRecon\nnmap scan\nWe start with nmap to perform a full port scan (-p-) using service detection (-sV), default scripts (-sC), disabled ping probes (-Pn) and outputting the scan results to a text file (-oN [filename]).\n\nThis scan reveals two TCP services running on port 8000 (a HTTP service) and port 22 (SSH Access)\n\nPort 22 (SSH 8.2p1)\nThe SSH server is configured with some old and insecure algorithms. This can be assessed by ssh-audit however this isn't a particularly relevant finding initially. However this is still report worthy. This also suggests an Ubuntu environment.\n\nPort 8000 (HTTP - Gunicorn/20.0.4)\nThe web application running on port 8000 does look promising for exploitation, a registered user can simply run arbitrary javascript in the browser. The source code for the website is also freely available for download.\n\nSource code analysis\nBy parsing the requirements.txt in the source supplied we find a flask 3.0.3 application and an app secret in the source code:\napp.py\n\nWe can also observe that the code that runs when the 'Run Code' button is pressed, appears to use js2py v0.74 to handle the javascript evaluation via python, executing it server side, and finally bringing back the result as the HTTP response.\nThis input is largely unsanitized both in and out of the application, giving us rise to consider server side command execution vulnerabilities. XSS is a consideration, although that is complicated by the fact that the result is converted to JSON first.\nSince the version of js2py is reported as 0.74 in requirements.txt it is possible that this code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-28397 - a sanbox escape. This weakness is well-known and best described by CWE-94: Insecure Control of Code Generation\nThe offending code defining the /run_code route in app.py\n\nFoothold - app user\nThere is a publicly available exploit example on github that we can modify and use to gain a foothold on the webserver. We don't need the PHP wrapper to execute this since we have the websites JS sandbox at our disposal. By modifying the first line we can cause the webserver to attempt to pipe a bash shells input and output to our machine at 10.10.14.19:4242. This script uses the fact that js2py versions up to 0.74 would inadvertantly allow the running code to read into the python subprocess library and execute the Popen command. It does this under the same privilege as the user running the website.\nexploit.js\n\nBy setting up a listener and running this in the browser, we gain a foothold as username app.\n\nPost-Exploitation\nA quick cat /etc/passwd shows us that there is root, app and marco as shelled users on the box. We don't have access to marco's files so we either need to escalate our privileges to root or marco in order to solve this box.\nThe /home/app/app/instance directory houses the users.db file that we can exfiltrate and inspect offline. It is a SQLite 3.x database. Kali comes with sqlitebrowser, that gives us a GUI way to browse its contents, and its in the users table where we can find the password hash for the user marco.\n\nThese are raw MD5 hashes and the marco hash is vulnerable to a dictionary attack using john\n\nBy using the username marco and password sweetangelbabylove we're able to login via SSH as marco and get the first flag for the foothold!\nPrivilege Escalation\nInspecting the sudoers with sudo -l shows that marco can run a backup utility called npbackup-cli with sudo, making this a possible privesc vulnerability if we can force this tool to do our bidding.\n\nLoLbin: npbackup-cli\nAs luck would have it, there is a misconfiguration based privilege escalation proof of concept on github. By uploading and modifying this file we can read the root flag or the shadow file.\n\nAnd following up with this command to dump the backup we saved as root.\n\nRoot Access\nThe above root hash wasn't easily crackable with john and rockyou.txt so I just used the above approach to guess the flag location and read out /root/root.txt to yield the flag: 09cd485933fb29e34fefb7f5a9ea00d8 -- which is a shortcut.\nHowever, it should be noted that the following private key is stored in /root/.ssh/id_rsa which can be used to login as the root account.\n\nThis key is passwordless, and allows immediate SSH access to the flag.\n\n\nSuggested remediations\n\nMaintain regular patching of code libraries and dependencies in the web application\nReconsider allowing code execution directly against the webserver host via the website, apply segregation of responsibility to the application architecure, e.g. use of epehermeral execution environments that cannot access the webserver host.\nEnsure passwords are strong and not reused between applications and services. Always use password protected certificates for all privileged access (e.g. via SSH, databases, etc)\nAvoid manual backup procedures that rely on low privileged users having elevated privilege. Consider a seperate backup server with RBAC to prevent unauthorized access to the webservers root filesystem.\n\nMy review: 4 stars\nI enjoyed this box as it was simple and somewhat realistic - developer tooling has historically been a problematic area because of the need to run as administrator on workstations, and CI/CD tooling needing to allow remote arbitrary code excetion as a feature. Normally this would be considered a security flaw - not a feature! So the owners of these tools need to be extremely careful about sandboxing the environment that allows untrusted input.\nI didn't give it 5 stars because I think that the scenario is a little contrived and it would be (IMO) more interesting to explore a box that attempted to give this feature to others with some more thought given to the architecture. Given 'code' part one used docker containers (if I recall correctly), this approach seems like a regression rather than an improved architecture.\n","description":"","id":"https://trapdoorsec.com/walkthrough/code-part-2/","path":"/walkthrough/code-part-2/","title":"HTB Walkthrough: CodePartTwo"}},"docInfo":{"https://trapdoorsec.com/":{"body":14,"description":0,"path":0,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/20-years-of-appsec/":{"body":1569,"description":0,"path":4,"title":7},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/about-me/":{"body":98,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/cyber-security-act-q3-2024/":{"body":265,"description":0,"path":6,"title":6},"https://trapdoorsec.com/blog/the-cost-of-complacency/":{"body":1151,"description":0,"path":3,"title":6},"https://trapdoorsec.com/project/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/project/dvwapi/":{"body":676,"description":9,"path":2,"title":1},"https://trapdoorsec.com/walkthrough/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":2},"https://trapdoorsec.com/walkthrough/code-part-2/":{"body":731,"description":0,"path":4,"title":3}},"length":11},"lang":"English"}
