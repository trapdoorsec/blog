:wave: Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find this blog valuable in some way. :pray:

I started my career in IT as a junior software programmer way back in the olden days (1999). This turned into web application 
development, then application security roles, and I now find myself in cybersecurity governance, risk management & compliance, 
and leadership positions. For as long as I can remember, in my spare time I've been hacking into and reverse engineering things.

I've seen a lot of things change and a lot of things stay the same over the years. I mainly write about the technologies I've learned,
or ideas I've come across. 

:detective: In case you're curious, I'll save you some OSINT legwork. LinkedIn leaked most of it back in 2021 so you may
as well read it here anyway.
